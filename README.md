# Stock Trading Dashboard Project

## Overview

The Stock Trading Dashboard Project is designed to assist traders in identifying potential trade opportunities by monitoring the historical correlation between two stocks. The project aims to provide a visual representation of when the correlation between two stocks weakens, indicating potential trade strategies for buying the relatively underperforming stock and selling the relatively outperforming stock.

The development is based on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualization software, which is now open source. The project includes features for interfacing with financial data feeds, making necessary adjustments, and implementing a chart on the trader's dashboard to visualize trade opportunities.

## Setup

1. **Local Development Environment:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Install necessary dependencies and tools (check requirements.txt or project documentation).

2. **Fix Client Datafeed Script:**
   - Locate the client datafeed script in the repository.
   - Make the required adjustments to handle the financial data for monitoring trade opportunities.

3. **Generate Patch File:**
   - After fixing the client datafeed script, generate a patch file to document the changes made.

4. **Add Unit Tests:**
   - Add unit tests to the test script in the repository to ensure the correctness of the modifications.

## Usage

Run the main script to query financial data, calculate relevant metrics, and visualize potential trade opportunities on the dashboard.
